# Progress

## 2026-04-17

### Current status

- Repo scaffolded as a Cargo workspace.
- Initial crates created:
  - `pd-core`
  - `pd-control`
  - `pd-cli`
  - `pd-eval`
- `fixtures/scenarios/` created for authored scenario inputs.
- First `pd-core` contract slice is now implemented and compiling.

### Active implementation focus

1. Add `pd-control` controller traits and a baseline controller.
2. Wire a minimal `pd-cli run` path for one flat terminal-descent scenario.
3. Keep artifacts simple and authoritative:
   - run manifest
   - action log
   - event log
   - optional sampled/debug trace

### Notes

- Start contract-first. Avoid building physics details before command, terrain,
  mission, and artifact types are stable.
- Use a fixed physics step with lower-rate controller updates and held commands.
- Treat sampled traces as optional report/debug caches, not the replay source of
  truth.

### Checkpoints

#### Checkpoint 1: `pd-core` contracts and loop

- Added the first shared domain types:
  - sim config and cadence validation
  - terrain and landing pad specs
  - vehicle geometry/specs
  - scenario/run context
  - observation, command, event, action, sample, and manifest artifacts
- Implemented a minimal deterministic simulation loop with:
  - fixed-rate physics stepping
  - lower-rate controller updates via held commands
  - simple hull/touchdown contact classification
  - terminal outcomes for on-target landing, off-target landing, crash, and timeout
- Added `pd-core` smoke tests for:
  - cadence validation
  - terrain interpolation
  - authoritative action/event/sample capture

### Known limitations

- Mission goals are still limited to landing-on-pad scenarios.
- Contact/landing logic is intentionally simple and will need refinement before
  richer terrain or transfer-style evaluations.
- The replay path still depends on optional sampled traces for convenience;
  action/event-only reconstruction is not implemented yet.
